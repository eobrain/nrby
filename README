This is a Palm WebOS app that displays photographs that other people
have taken close to your current location.

Before building the app you will need to get a Flickr API key from
http://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply/? and add it to the
appinfo.json file.

There are several ways to build this app, including the Eclipse IDE or
the ARES online IDE.  Alternatively if you are on a Mac or a Windows
PC woith Cygwin you can use the Makefile provided.  Just type "make"
to run JSLint on the code and then package and install on the Palm
Emulator or actual device.
