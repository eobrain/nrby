	display view: <strong>flick sideways</strong> to see more
	photos, <strong>tap the full-screen button</strong> to hide
	the visible controls, <strong>tap the "i" button</strong> to

	Google Map app in a new card.</p>
      
      <p class="palm-body-text" x-mojo-loc=''> As with most WebOS apps
	you can get back to the previous view by making the <strong>back
	  gesture</strong> right-to-left on the blank area below the screen.

      <h2 class="palm-group-title">How photos are found</h2>

      <p class="palm-body-text" x-mojo-loc=''>The application queries
      Flickr to return the most "interesting" photos in a given radius
      around your current position. (Where "Interestingness" is a
      value that Flickr calculates for each photograph based on many
      different factors.)  It does not know ahead of time the local
      density of photographs, so it repeatedly tries querying with
      different search radiuses until it gets backs a reasonable
      number of photographs.  It shows the most interesting photograph
      initially, and as you flick left and right away from the initial
      photograph you get next most interesting photographs.  </p>

      <p class="palm-body-text" x-mojo-loc=''>In the application menu,
      under "Preferences", you can switch the application to ask
      Flickr for the most recent photographs, rather than the most
      interesting.</p>
      
      <p class="palm-body-text" x-mojo-loc=''>The application will
      only do a new query with a new search radius when you have not
      touched the application for a little while, so try not touching
      the phone for about ten seconds to see if you get some new
      photos. </p>
